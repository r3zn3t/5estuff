				"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vampires are pale, humanoid beings who are neither dead nor alive. They are Undead, feeding from the life force of living things. They have dark, even reddish eyes and long, sharp fangs that can be retracted at will. They are known for their strength, speed, and charm, which can be a very deadly combination. Apart from their gained undead appearance, they look very similar to whatever they looked like in life. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like liches, they often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors."
