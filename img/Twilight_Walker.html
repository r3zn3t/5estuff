<p>Nightwalkers of the Feywild are bright mirrors of the horrifying creatures that stalk the Shadowfell. Feared and worshiped as forest gods, these creatures are among the oldest and most powerful fey spirits.</p>
<p><em><strong>Avenger of Life.</strong></em> Twilight walkers normally dwell as beasts among the forests and woodlands of the Feywild, moving from place to place unseen in the dead of night. Sought by the pure of heart, they can bring healing and life. Slain in this form, the twilight walker flies into a terrible rage and is driven only to destroy, focusing its wrath first on its murderer and thenceforth on any settlements or populated areas.<br>
An angered twilight walker cannot change shape and rampages until destroyed, or until resurrection magic such as <em>raise dead</em> is used upon it. The long casting time and short range of such spells makes this an extraordinarily difficult task.</p>
<p><em><strong>Immortal Curse.</strong></em> If a twilight walker is destroyed in its true form, its spirit will be reincarnated in the next born foal or calf closest to where the walker was defeated, typically born of a deer, elk, or horse. If the flesh of a slain twilight walker is eaten before the walker is reincarnated, the twilight walker is forever destroyed, and the eater is thereafter subject to the twilight walker's immortality curse. A cursed creature is forever reincarnated the next midnight after it dies, as the <em>reincarnate</em> spell, but also subject to a permanent <em>antipathy</em> spell affecting only beasts. Removing the curse removes both effects.</p>

<p><em><strong>Aura of Life and Death.</strong></em> All creatures other than undead and constructs that end their turn within 30 feet of the twilight walker either gain 10  temporary hit points, or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, either flourish and bloom, or wither and die instantly. The twilight walker can change the type of aura as a bonus action.</p>
<p><em><strong>Innate Spellcasting.</strong></em> The twilight walker can cast <em>invisibility</em> and <em>plant growth</em> at will, without using any components.</p>
<p><em><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong></em> The twilight walker has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Shapechanger.</strong></em> At dusk, midnight, or dawn, the twilight walker can polymorph into an elk-like creature with multicolored fur and a humanoid face, or back into its true form. In this form, it has the statistics of a unicorn (including hit points) except that it is fey instead of celestial, and it retains its alignment, languages, and this action.</p>
<p>If the twilight walker is slain while in its alternate form, at the start of its next turn it returns to its true form at full hit points. If destroyed in its true form,<br>
it vanishes.</p>
<section id="twilight-walker-2-actions">
<h3 id="twilight-walker-2-actions">Actions</h3>
<p><em><strong>Multiattack.</strong></em> The  walker makes two slam attacks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slam.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (4d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.</p>
<p><em><strong>Withering Gaze.</strong></em> The twilight walker fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage.</p>
